## What is a virtual science forum?

A VSF is a fully digital conference, where participants and speakers join remotely via audio & video software.

Scientific conferences often require traveling to other parts of the world. 
Modern technology, however, enables us to host virtual conferences with thousands of viewers and 
hundreds of interacting participants.

Hosting a virtual conference has multiple benefits:

* Reduction in CO2 emission due to elimination of travel
* Enabling participants who are otherwise constrained (family) to participate
* Prevent pandemics

## How does it work?

If you are interested in organizing a VSF, we recommend going over the [Organizer Guide](organizerguide.md).

If you have been invited to speak at a virtual conference, the [Speaker Guide](speakerguide.md) is for you.
