# Virtual Science Forum: Attendee Guide

As an attendee, of course your job is the easiest. However, with this new conferencing format, certain things, like asking questions, are now different. Below we provide guidelines regarding your attendance and technical instructions on how to interact. 

## Guidelines

* Be polite and respectful.
* Hostile, disruptive, or disrespectful behaviour will be monitored by the moderator
* Continuous misbehaviour will lead to a termination of your participation in the session upon the decision of the moderator(s).
* Try to stay for the complete event.
* Use your real name when logging in.
* Check your internet connection and microphone sound quality in advance. 
* Coordinate with colleagues to watch jointly. 
* Consider keeping the camera running as a courtesy to the speaker.
* Use the chat to contact the moderators if you have an important technical remarks.

## Asking Questions

### How to ask

You cannot unmute your microphone on your own. Zoom has a “raise hand” feature which you should use to alert the moderator about a question:

1. Open the participants pane (we recommend doing this at the beginning of the talk). 
2. Click the “raise your hand” button. Your name, now with a raised hand symbol, will go to the top of the participants list, which the moderator will be monitoring. 
3. The moderator will alert the speaker, announce your name, and unmute your microphone. 
4. Ask your question! 
5. When the interaction ends, the moderator will mute your microphone and “lower your hand”. 

### When to ask

Short talks: after the talk ends.

Long talks: ask your questions at any time.
