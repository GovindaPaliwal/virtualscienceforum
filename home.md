## Welcome

Virtual Science Forum is a volunteer-run open platform aiming to accommodate organization of online conferences.
We provide support and hosting of virtual conference sessions.
Additionally we develop best practices and provide detailed guidelines for all community members.

## Inaugural event

Like many in the physics community we were saddened to hear of the cancellation of the APS March Meeting—a cornerstone conference for the worldwide physics community.
To counteract this disruption, and following a successful beta testing, we are now ready to launch the first online conference session, and allow the community members catch up with the latest news.

### Program

We are starting Friday 6 March 12:00 EST ([click to check in your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/New%20York/2020-03-06/12:00/Virtual%20Science%20Forum%20inaugural%20meeting#eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3ZpcnR1YWxzY2llbmNlZm9ydW0ub3JnLyJ9)).
