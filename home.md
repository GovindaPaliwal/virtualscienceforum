## Welcome

Virtual Science Forum is a volunteer-run open platform aiming to accommodate organization of online conferences.
We provide support and hosting of virtual conference sessions.
Additionally we develop best practices and provide detailed guidelines for all community members.

## Where we stand

We ran the first public virtual session focusing on machine learning in quantum physics and quantum computation, check the videos [here](inauguralsession.md).

We are now improving the materials, and in parallel we accept applications for further virtual conferences.
Check out the [organizer guide](organizerguide.md) to see what it takes.
