# Moderator Guide


## Summary

Moderation of a virtual conference involves more responsibility than chairing an offline session.
Speaker-audience interaction is important for the success of a talk, but in a virtual environment it becomes more complicated.
The moderator takes on the following responsibilities: 

* announce and introduce the conference,
* remind the audience of the seminar format, when questions are allowed, and how to raise hands to ask questions,
* initiate a seminar by highlighting the speaker’s screen-share, unmuting their microphone, and introducing them by announcing their name, 	institution, and talk title,
* monitor the participant list for raised hands and enable those attendees to ask questions,
* close a seminar by thanking the speaker for their talk, muting and un-highlighting the speaker, and making any transition announcements,
* handle any technical issues with the execution of the virtual conference,
* monitor participant behavior in the chat for breaches of the code of conduct.

Below we provide more detailed information on certain aspects of the moderator role. 

## How to

### Transition seminars

A seminar is ready to start, highlight the speaker’s screen-share, introduce the speaker (name, current institution, something about the talk or their current work), and then unmute the speaker to allow them to begin their seminar.

When a seminar has concluded, thank the speaker and then enter the post-talk question/answer period if there will be one (see guidelines on questions below).
After this, mute their microphone, and stop highlighting their screen-share.
If the seminar ended early then you may pause until it is time for the next one to start.

NB: a virtual conference cannot have applause after the seminar ends! However, Zoom does have a clapping hands image that audience members may put up next to their name in the participants list. 


### Question guidelines

Unless otherwise agreed by the organizers, the following guidelines apply:

* Short talks: after the talk ends.
* Long talks: questions may be asked at any time.

In general, mediating questions works like this:

* Monitor the participants list to observe attendees signaling for questions (“Raise hand option”).
* Let speaker and audience know that there is a question, and signal the asker by stating their name and unmuting their microphone.
* Leave the attendee unmuted while interacting with the speaker.
* Mute the attendee when finished, and “lower their hand”.
* In the event of a prolonged discussion, you may get the talk back on track by suggesting that the conversation continue separately after the seminar.


### Deal with technical issues

Just as in a non-virtual seminar, technical issues may crop up. Here, they can take the form of degraded/lost internet connection, computer failure, etc. Where possible, the moderator should do their best to resolve or manage technical issues that disrupt a seminar.

* Speaker-side issues: where possible, try to have a second line of communication with the speakers in case an issue comes up on their end.
* Audience-side issues: attendees are instructed to send chat messages directly to the moderator if technical issues arise on their end, and the moderator must make a judgement call as to whether some kind of action should be taken.

Moderators should report on any such issues (and fixes) to the organizers or the VSF team, and also encourage such feedback from all participants.


### Deal with misconduct

In the event of misconduct (defined by the code of conduct) from any participant moderators need to take the following actions:

* Warn involved participant(s) of their behaviour and the possible consequences.
* Remove repeat offenders from the session.
* Overlook chat interactions where the same rules apply.
