# Organizer Guide

## Summary
As the organizers, your task is to coordinate all the high-level aspects of a virtual science forum. This page provides helpful guidelines and checklists to ensure an as-smooth-as-possible experience for yourself as well as for all of the participants, speakers and moderators.

## ToDo list
 - [ ] Read through this documentation once
 - [ ] [Decide on a relevant topic](#topic-selection)
 - [ ] [Approach potential speakers](#invite-speakers)
 - [ ] [Begin setting up a conference website](#website-setup)
 - [ ] [Decide on the audiovisual software](#software-selection)
 - [ ] [Hold a trial run](#trial-run)

## Topic selection
If you've reached this point, you are likely thinking about organizing a virtual conference. That means you perhaps have an idea for a topic that your conference would be about. Before going through with the rest of the organization, we've put together a list of a few important pointers to think about carefully.

* How large is the community?
  * This is an important point. Virtual conferences work well at intermediate scales in terms of participants (although the limit on 'view-only' participants is virtually absent).
* How relevant is the topic?
  * Virtual conferences are great for new and upcoming topics, in which progress is quick.
* More to come!

## Invite speakers
At this point, most people have little to no experience with a virtual conference. Having a demonstration for them
to look at can therefore be very helpful, and we suggest pointing them towards our [Speaker Guide](speakerguide.md). Once you have
set up your conference website (see [Website Setup](#website-setup)), you can easily modify the guides to include your own preferences.

## Website setup
Having all of the information (times, program, speakers) and guides together in an attractive web environment can make a big difference.
The website you're reading right now, or the [conference website template](http://www.virtualscienceforum.org/docs), can directly be copied and edited
for your conference. Doing so requires a minimal understanding of GitHub.

### Steps
!! These steps are not fully functional as-is! We are still working on the best (easiest) way for new organizers to get up and running.

1. Create a GitHub account for the conference. Alternatively, use a GitHub account of one of the organizers. Please be aware that in order to edit the website, a GitHub account is necessary also for other users.
2. Visit the [template GitHub page](https://github.com/virtualscienceforum/docs) and select "Fork" in the top right to create a copy in your own (or new) GitHub account.
3. In your own account, select "settings". You will be shown the "Options" tab automatically. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section, and in the "source" part select the master branch.
4. In your forked repository, feel free to remove the organizer guide (be sure to also remove it from the _sidebar.md file). We recommend keeping (and editing if required) the speaker and moderator guides to fit your needs and expectations.
5. You can add files to create new pages (be sure to add them to _sidebar.md if you want them to show up in the sidebar). These files use "markdown" to define elements like lists, tables, headers and figures. The files in the repository have examples of all of those, but if you'd rather have an external resource on the markdown language: [see here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## Software selection
We have been using Zoom as the virtual conference software.

## Trial run
To make sure speakers and moderators know what to do and expect, holding a trial run can be extremely important. We recommend asking the speakers and moderators to join for a 10 minute test so that they all can make sure their hardware works and become familiarized with the conferencing platform.
